Here are a couple sources to help out with forensics questions

Decoding
  Decoding is ez with this stuff
  
SDDL String in a file
  “(Get-Acl “Full Directory”) .SDDL”
  
File Permissions of A SMB Share
  “Get-SmbShareAccess -Name The name of the share” 
  
SID of Deleted Users
  Only works if Active Directory Recycle bin is enabled
  "Get-ADObject -ldapFilter:"(msDS-LastKnownRDN=*)" -IncludeDeletedObjects -properties *
    uhh run this command thru a fact check... idk if it works and i haven't tested in a bit
  
Previously used powershell commands
  Only works if Powershell Transcription is enabled
  Local Group Policy Editor
  Filter by the state of configured policies and look for “Turn on Powershell Transcription”
  Click on that and look for “Transcript Output Directory”
  
Files?
  U can view another user’s files thru “this PC”, then go to “users”, in file explorer
  U can see the properties of a file thru right clicking it then properties
  U can see other properties of the file by searching up <file type> viewer
  If u r still stuck i wanna feel bad for u
  Ig if u wanna see more files stuff.

Backdoor via ports
  "Netstat -anob"
  Look at the listening ports
  Look at the ip address 
  Last bit of the address is what’s important
  Look up the address

File Hashes
  "Get-FileHash -algorithm ____ C:/watever filepath | Format-List"
    Types of algorithms
    SHA1
    SHA256
    SHA384
    SHA512
    MD5
    
Oh, are MMC snap-ins Unavailable?
  It’s probably blocked in a registry key.
  Open Registry Editor
  All the snap ins are in the key:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MMC\Snapins
  I know that the names of the snapins may look intimidating like {1823qhfiaw} but u just need to click on it and look for the part that says “name string”, then if its the one that is blocked, u change the (default)
  
SSH info

Information related to a certain process (like where a backdoor is)
  Open process explorer (from sysinternals)
  Look for the process (More on that here) 
  
Services that are scheduled to start/service permissions
