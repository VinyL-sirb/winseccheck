1) COPY UR README AND FORENSICS QUESTIONS INTO ANOTHER DOC
  I know that you prob won't think abt it later, but it is good to have the resources when doing a postround debrief.

2) Do your forensic questions.
  If you are stuck on one of them, try switching off to another windows specialist for new eyes on the puzzle
  There are some resources in the forensics file as well

3) Go through users/groups in both control panel and mmc
  Technically you can do everything in mmc, but its easier to see admin group and if they have password in control panel
  The following powershell command lists all admin to make looking through stuff easier:
    Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
  In mmc ensure that none of the accounts are disabled and all of the passwords will expire + user can change password
  While you are in mmc it would also be nice to go thru shares

4) Update Needed Programs and Start Updating Windows

5) Quickly Scroll through Services
