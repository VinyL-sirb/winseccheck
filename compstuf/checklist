1) COPY UR README AND FORENSICS QUESTIONS INTO ANOTHER DOC
  I know that you prob won't think abt it later, but it is good to have the resources when doing a postround debrief.

2) Do your forensic questions.
  If you are stuck on one of them, try switching off to another windows specialist for new eyes on the puzzle
  There are some resources in the forensics file as well

3) Go through users/groups in both control panel and mmc
  Technically you can do everything in mmc, but its easier to see admin group and if they have password in control panel
  The following powershell command lists all admin to make looking through stuff easier:
    Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators"
  In mmc ensure that none of the accounts are disabled and all of the passwords will expire + user can change password
  While you are in mmc it would also be nice to go thru shares

4) Update Needed Programs and Start Updating Windows

5) Quickly Scroll through Services
  Look for:
    Stop and Disable
      IIS

        Common Firewall Exceptions
          • Core Networking– Regular Microsoft Windows services that retrieve data from the Internet
          – If you don’t enable this exception across all three types of networks, some Microsoft Services and programs will not run properly
          • File and Printer Sharing– Allows you to share the contents of selected folders and locally attached printers with other computers
          • Remote Assistance– Allows a user to temporarily remotely control another Windows computer over a network or the Internet to resolve issues
          • Remote Desktop– Allows users to access their user accounts and files remotely

13) Use your windows sysiternals
  a)Sigcheck64:
    ".\sigcheck.exe -u -e C:\windows\system32"
  b)Process Explorer:
    WIP

14) Check for Backdoors

15) Check for viruses on powershell
  "attrib -r -a -s -h *."
  anything that gives an output other than "Access Denied" could be malicous
