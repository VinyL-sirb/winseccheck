If Secpol isn’t working???
Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SecEdit
Right Click “Reg Values” and go to permissions. Adjust them so you are one of the people that can access them
If that still doesn’t work, look for the secpol file:
	Win+S, secpol. Right click and find file location. 
	Select open with MMC
